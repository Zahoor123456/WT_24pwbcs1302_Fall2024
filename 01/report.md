# Lab 01 Reflection - Web Technologies CS 224L

## What I Learned
During this lab session, I learned the basics of Git and GitHub. I practiced creating HTML files, adding comments, and managing different versions of my code. Understanding version control is essential for web development.

## Git Experience
I worked with branches by creating an "experiment" branch, added an experimental heading (<h2>), and then merged it back to the main branch. This taught me how developers can work on features separately without affecting the main code.

## File Management
I learned to track files with Git, ignore unnecessary files using .gitignore, and add proper documentation through LICENSE files. Creating and deleting test files showed me how Git tracks all changes.

## Conclusion
This lab gave me hands-on experience with essential Git commands that I'll use throughout my web development journey.
